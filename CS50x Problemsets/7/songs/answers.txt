with the query SELECT AVG(danceability), AVG(energy), AVG(valence) FROM songs;
the data shows
+-------------------+-------------+--------------+
| AVG(danceability) | AVG(energy) | AVG(valence) |
+-------------------+-------------+--------------+
| 0.71646           | 0.65906     | 0.484443     |

so i randomly choose 0.5 as a threshold for my Aura assumptions and
i would say that this Aura describes someone who, one hand likes energetic dancy music but also sad songs (the low valence)

to the second part i think, asking the question at all, in this context, is not a scientific approach.
Assuming that the consumed music does depend on the current mood and is not influenced by other people or other environmental factors like, just consuming music to avoid other noises,
but really just consumed out of an emotional state.
then the parameters chosen should clearly reflect that state, not a mean with no variance.
energy for example if someone in a more neutal state listens to music that stays around 0.5,
they could have the same score as someone who listens 50% of the time to very low and 50% to very high energetic music.
i don't think its sensible to calculate a Value that speaks to the users moods the reasons to listen to music and surrounding factors are to complex, to make any such assumptions.
